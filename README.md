# Express Routing Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice defining routes with Express
2. Practice using routes in an Express application
3. Apply RESTful principles to routing in Express

## Introduction

Students should build a small application focused on RESTful routing practices. The framing device could be a food cart: days of the week have menus, and menus have items (we can go deeper, but there's probably no need).

Tests should focus on REST and test the responses. It would be great to guide students towards a solid implementation, but ultimately the solution can be the standard.
